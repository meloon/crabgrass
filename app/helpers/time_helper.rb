  # Our goal here it to automatically display the date in the way that
  # makes the most sense. Elusive, i know. If an array of times is passed in
  # we display the newest one.
  # Here are the current options:
  #   4:30PM    -- time was today
  #   Wednesday -- time was within the last week.
  #   7/Mar     -- time was in the current year.
  #   7/Mar/08  -- time was in a different year.
  # The date is then wrapped in a label, so that if you hover over the text
  # you will see the full details.

  ##
  ## this does NOT actually expire the fragment cache, but it makes it invalid
  ## after three hours, which is just as good so long as you have an external
  ## job that cleans up after old files.
