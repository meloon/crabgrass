  # TODO
  # The way this works is incredibly stupid. Basically, we fetch all the task lists
  # that the user has access to and then we examine each task in those lists to see if
  # it has been completed. The problem is that we need to decide if we are searching for
  # *task lists* or *tasks*. If tasks, then we need some way to figure out what groups have
  # access to a particular task, or maybe that doesn't make sense since groups can't be
  # assigned to as task
