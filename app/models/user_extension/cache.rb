Caching IDs

The idea here is that every user in a social networking universe
has a lot of relationships to other entities that might be expensive
to discover. For example, a list of all your peers or a list of all
groups you have direct or indirect access to. So, we cache it, in
the form of serialized arrays of integers corresponding to the ids of the
foreign relationships.

If you are paying attention, you will realize this is stupid. A couple reasons
why it is not:

  (1) by using compressed integers for serialization, we can actually store
      a lot of ids without taking up too much space.
  (2) it is much faster to deserialize a big array of integers than it is
      to join in another table or make an extra query.

In many cases, all we *want* are the ids, since this is sufficient
to test membership and to display name and avatar (if ever get around
to creating a memcached for users and groups that stores [id,name,avatar_id]).

Also, we make a lot of queries of the form "group_id IN (1,2,3,4)".
This is fast, according to the mysql manual:

   If all values are constants, they are evaluated according to
   the type of expr and sorted. The search for the item then is
   done using a binary search. This means IN is very quick if
   the IN value list consists entirely of constants.

This suggests that if we stored the ids caches pre-sorted, it would be
slightly faster.

As a handy bit of fun, if any of these ids caches changes, we increment
the user's version. This can be then used to easily expire caches which
use these values.

Columns
--------

  version -- increments when any of the id caches are changed

  id caches -- there are many columns to cache our relationships,
    because they are used very frequently and take time to calculate.
    The names of the cache attributes end with "_cache".
