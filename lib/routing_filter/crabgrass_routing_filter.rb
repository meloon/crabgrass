#
# Routing in rails is a mysterious black box of insanity. Few who tread into
# its depths return to tell the tale. The meta-programming has meta-programming.
#
# Unfortunately, this block box has some serious problems when it comes to
# crabgrass.
#
# (1) globbing in routes messes up rails route recognition. It sometimes work
# but then will fail for other routes. If you write a test for it using
# assert_recognizes, the tests all pass. But when you run the code in the server,
# it breaks. It is a nightmare.
#
# For example:
#
#   map.connect 'groups/:action/:id/*path',
#     :controller => 'groups',
#     :action => /search/
#
#   url_for(:controller => 'groups', :action => 'search',
#     :id => 'rainbow', :path => ['ascending','title'])
#
#   => /groups/search/animals?path[]=ascending&path[]=title
#
# (2) we really want to be able to do /groupname and /username urls. This is
# very nice and pretty and easy to remember. However, different controllers
# need to be called depending on what type of object is at /name.
#
# The code here in this file is a wrapper around the black box of rails routing.
# In effect, we have wrapped our own black box around the rails black box.
#
# Our wrapper simply overrides the behavior of rails so that the routing code
# appears to the rest of the application to work like we want it to.
#
# This relies on Sven Fuchs awesome routing-filter plugin:
# http://github.com/svenfuchs/routing-filter/tree/master

  #
  # often, rails will fail mysteriously to generate globbed paths.
  # maddeningly, it works perfectly well in tests.
  #
  # this hack takes a url of the form:
  #
  #   /groups/search/animals?path[]=type&path[]=text
  #
  # and converts it into:
  #
  #   /groups/search/animals/type/text
  #
  # both will work, but the latter is a tad more attractive!
  #
  # this hack only works if the glob part is called 'path', like:
  #
  #   map.connect 'person/:action/:id/*path', :controller => 'person'
  #
  QUERY_RE = /\?.*$/
