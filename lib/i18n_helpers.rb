=begin

ways to translate a string:

  "Hello"[:hello]
  "Hello".t
  :hello.t
  "Hello %s" / id
  _('Hello')

Too many! _ and / should not be used.

class String

  def /(*args)
    self.t().%(*args)
  end

  # discard capitalization
  alias :t :[]

end

def _(str)
  str[]
end

class Symbol
  def t()
    # this special form will default to english if the symbol
    # cannot be found for the current language.
    ""[self]
  end
end

#
# override the gibberish translation method
#
# NOTE:
# This relies on a hack to Gibberish which turns
# Gibberish.translations[x] from a Hash to a HashWithIndifferentAccess
# (we don't want to create a bunch of symbols that are never
# going to be used)
#
#
# NOTE 2:
# this is moved to gibberish plugin, because I can't figure out how to get
# it working here.
