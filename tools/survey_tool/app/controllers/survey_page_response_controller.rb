  # xhr and get
  # The user may either rate the current response, or skip it. The response
  # has either been rated already or not. If it has been rated already, it may
  # have been given a rating of nil, to let us know that the user has skipped it.
  #
  # There is a slight problem, which I am not sure how to solve. If the user skips
  # a response by choosing not to rate it, we cannot put it at the end of the
  # 'unrated' queue because this makes it impossible to skip the last unrated
  # response. However, if we put the skipped item at the bottom of the rated
  # queue, it makes it so you won't see it for a long time.
  #
  # This is how it works now, which I guess is better. Skip, then, means that you
  # really don't want to have to rate it.
