Currently, these fixtures are used for tests, but cannot be loaded via
"rake db:fixtures:load". Until we figure out how to make that happen, these
fixtures should be used only for testing, not for seeding the db in development
mode. For development mode, you have to put fixtures in the main test/fixtures
directory.
